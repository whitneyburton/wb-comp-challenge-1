# Static Comp Challenge 1 
---
**Project description**: For this static comp we were challenged to recreate a responsive website which includes a nav bar and a series of 8 cards. This site had to be responsive to as low as 320 pixels wide. We were expected to reflect every small detail from the comp example including spacing, layout, and utilzing a good choice of color palette and photos/icons.
